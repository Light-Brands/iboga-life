> Discover the transformative healing powers across physical, mental, and spiritual dimensions

> In our modern world where depression, anxiety, addiction, and chronic illness have become increasingly common, Iboga emerges as a powerful medicine offering essential keys to restoring and maintaining health within ourselves and our communities. This sacred plant works on multiple levels - physical, mental, and spiritual - providing comprehensive healing that addresses the root causes of suffering.

> The healing properties of Iboga are both profound and far-reaching. Physically, it acts as a powerful detoxifier, rapidly cleansing the body while addressing numerous ailments. Mentally and spiritually, it facilitates deep introspection and trauma release, helping individuals reconnect with their authentic selves and life purpose.

> Complete body regeneration through cellular detoxification and healing

> Detoxifying the entire body at the cellular level

> Resetting neurotransmitters & increasing neuroplasticity

> Cleansing & balancing the body for optimal performance

> Repairing through antiparasitic, antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral properties

> Reducing inflammation & relieving attachment to pain

> Iboga root contains potent bitter compounds that work rapidly to detoxify the body at the cellular level. This powerful plant medicine addresses a wide range of physical conditions including heavy metal buildup, viral infections like HPV and herpes, skin conditions such as acne, Lyme disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, insomnia, and various digestive problems.

> Beyond detoxification, Iboga's anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-parasitic properties work synergistically to repair and restore the body's natural healing mechanisms. This comprehensive approach to physical healing creates the foundation for optimal health and vitality.

> Deep psychological transformation through seeing the truth and neural rewiring

> Detoxing unnecessary conscious & subconscious thoughts

> Showing us all the ways we lie to ourselves so we can be 100% honest

> Returning the mind to its natural state of peace & clarity

> Eliminating external programming & making room for truth

> Guiding us in releasing attachments to the past

> The visionary nature of Iboga often facilitates profound inner journeys that enable participants to clear past traumas and discover the root causes of what prevents them from living with joy and purpose. This sacred medicine effectively supports healing from depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, ADD, ADHD, addiction, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors.

> Through its unique ability to facilitate honest self-examination, Iboga helps individuals see through the lies they tell themselves, eliminate external programming, and return the mind to its natural state of peace and clarity. This process of mental detoxification creates space for truth and authentic living.

> Iboga is globally recognized for its remarkable anti-addictive properties and plays a crucial role in the detoxification and rehabilitation from various substances including amphetamines, opiates, alcohol, nicotine, and many pharmaceuticals. Unlike conventional treatments, Iboga not only strips harmful substances from the body and reduces withdrawal discomfort, but also invites participants to examine the original reasons behind their substance use.

> This unique combination of physical detoxification and psychological insight addresses addiction at its core, offering individuals a genuine opportunity for lasting recovery and transformation. The medicine guides people to understand their patterns and make conscious choices for their healing.

> Ancient wisdom, sacred rituals, and the path to spiritual enlightenment

> The Bwiti Tradition is an ancient spiritual path originating from the forests of Gabon, Central Africa, carried for generations by the Fang, Mitsogo, and Apinji peoples. It is not a religion in the Western sense, but a way of life — a lived wisdom rooted in truth, self-knowledge, and direct experience.

> At the heart of Bwiti is the understanding that everything we need is already within us. The tradition guides people to remember who they truly are beneath fear, trauma, addiction, and the stories that life places on them. Rather than giving beliefs to follow, Bwiti opens the door for people to see for themselves.

> The sacred plant medicine Iboga is central within the Bwiti path. It is known as the "Tree of Knowledge," a master teacher that helps individuals reconnect with their soul, confront their truth, and release the burdens they've been carrying — sometimes for decades or even generations.

> Within the Bwiti, Iboga is not used casually or recreationally. It is taken with deep reverence, ceremony, and preparation. Traditionally trained providers support guests spiritually, emotionally, and physically through the process, ensuring safety, clarity, and guidance.

> Bwiti doesn't preach dogma. Instead, it teaches truth through direct experience:

> Discovering your authentic self beneath all conditioning

> Understanding the patterns and stories that shape your reality

> Connecting with your soul's mission and life direction

> Releasing what no longer serves your highest good

> Restoring connection with your soul and ancestors

> Embodying honesty, truth, and personal responsibility

> Music, dance, fire, storytelling, and community all play important roles. These elements help open the senses, anchor the mind, and connect participants with the spiritual world.

#### The Bwiti Tradition
Ancient wisdom, sacred rituals, and the path to spiritual enlightenment

The Bwiti Tradition is an ancient spiritual path originating from the forests of Gabon, Central Africa, carried for generations by the Fang, Mitsogo, and Apinji peoples. It is not a religion in the Western sense, but a way of life — a lived wisdom rooted in truth, self-knowledge, and direct experience.

At the heart of Bwiti is the understanding that everything we need is already within us. The tradition guides people to remember who they truly are beneath fear, trauma, addiction, and the stories that life places on them. Rather than giving beliefs to follow, Bwiti opens the door for people to see for themselves.

#### Iboga: The Teacher Plant
Iboga: The Teacher Plant

The sacred plant medicine Iboga is central within the Bwiti path. It is known as the "Tree of Knowledge," a master teacher that helps individuals reconnect with their soul, confront their truth, and release the burdens they've been carrying — sometimes for decades or even generations.

Within the Bwiti, Iboga is not used casually or recreationally. It is taken with deep reverence, ceremony, and preparation. Traditionally trained providers support guests spiritually, emotionally, and physically through the process, ensuring safety, clarity, and guidance.

#### A Tradition Built on Truth

Seeing Your Life Clearly

Understanding the patterns and stories that shape your reality

Understanding Your Purpose

Releasing what no longer serves your highest good

Restoring connection with your soul and ancestors

> Discover the ancient wisdom of West African plant medicine

> Iboga, the root bark of the Iboga tree, is a West African plant medicine used for thousands of years by locals as a sacrament for deep healing and spiritual discovery. It is now renowned as the most effective plant medicine in promoting and sustaining positive long-term change in people's lives.

> This powerful medicine works on multiple levels - physical, mental, and spiritual - offering profound insights and healing that can transform your relationship with yourself and the world around you.

> Recognized as one of humanity's most ancient visionary plant medicines, the Iboga plant flourishes in the dense rainforests of West Africa. For millennia, this sacred medicine has served as a cornerstone for healing and spiritual initiation, now emerging to share its profound wisdom with our modern world.

> In an era where depression, anxiety, addiction, and illness have become widespread challenges, this powerful medicine offers essential keys to restoring and maintaining wellness within ourselves and our communities.

> The Iboga root contains potent bitter compounds that rapidly cleanse the body and address numerous physical conditions including heavy metal toxicity, viral infections, skin disorders, Lyme disease, chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, and digestive issues.

> The visionary nature of this plant medicine often guides participants through profound inner journeys, enabling the release of past traumas and revealing the root causes of what prevents living with joy and purpose. Iboga effectively supports recovery from depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, attention disorders, addiction, and obsessive behaviors.

> Renowned for its remarkable anti-addictive properties, Iboga serves as a crucial ally in overcoming dependencies on stimulants, opiates, alcohol, nicotine, and various pharmaceuticals. Beyond physical detoxification and withdrawal relief, it invites deep introspection into the underlying reasons for substance use.

> During the Iboga ceremony, the inner root bark of the Tabernanthe Iboga plant is carefully prepared into a fine powder and consumed. While each person's experience is unique, the common journey leads inward—a profound exploration of self-discovery where participants reconnect with their soul and life purpose.

About Jay

Warrior Spirit, Compassionate Guide, Master Provider

Meet Jason Nzingo Gho Majanja

Traditionally trained Iboga Bwiti provider, initiated and trained in 2022 under 10th-generation Shaman Moughenda Mikala in Gabon, Africa.

The Calling

Nzingo's path to Iboga began during one of the most challenging times of his life. After struggling with addiction for over twenty years—caught in a cycle of destructive and self-sabotaging behaviors—he reached a point of deep realization: it was time to break free.

"I was done with the struggling. I was done with the suffering. I was done with the pain."

These words marked the beginning of Jay's transformation. What started as a desperate search for healing became a profound spiritual awakening that would reshape not only his life, but the lives of countless others seeking freedom from their own darkness.

The Transformation

In 2022, Nzingo attended his first Iboga retreat in Cancun, Mexico. The experience transformed his life. The profound wisdom, healing, and clarity he received awakened something powerful within him—an undeniable calling to walk the path of service through the sacred Iboga medicine.

This sacred plant medicine didn't just heal his wounds—it revealed his purpose as a guardian of ancient wisdom. From the depths of struggle to the heights of spiritual awakening, Jay's transformation through Iboga ignited an unbreakable calling to serve this sacred medicine.

The Training

Just two months later, his calling led him to Gabon, Africa, the birthplace of the Bwiti tradition. There, under the direct guidance of Shaman Moughenda Mikala, Nzingo immersed himself in the traditional study of Iboga, learning the ancient spiritual, energetic, and healing practices that have been passed down for generations.

Training with 10th-generation Shaman Moughenda Mikala

Immersed in ancient Bwiti rituals and sacred fire ceremonies

The Mission

Upon returning to Canada, Nzingo founded his own Iboga retreat practice, dedicated to helping others find freedom from their own struggles—whether it be addiction, trauma, anxiety, depression, or emotional stagnation. Through the wisdom of Iboga, he helps people reconnect with their true selves and remember who they are beyond pain and limitation.

"I'm proud to serve this sacred medicine to those seeking real change in their life. We don't have to stay stuck in our suffering. There is light on the other side—and Iboga helps us find it."

Jay's mission is to be a bridge between the ancient wisdom of plant medicine and the modern world's need for healing. With strength, love, and dedication, he guides souls through their journey of transformation, helping them reclaim their power and purpose.

Philosophy & Approach
Strength Through Presence

Jay's powerful physical presence creates a container of safety, allowing participants to fully surrender to their healing journey. His strength gives others permission to be vulnerable.

Nature's Wisdom

Living in harmony with nature has taught Jay the rhythms of transformation. He brings this primal wisdom to every ceremony, creating space for authentic healing.

Warrior Compassion

Combining the fierce protection of a warrior with deep compassion, Jay guides each person through their darkest moments into the light of understanding and healing.

Sacred Responsibility

Jay approaches his work with the utmost reverence and responsibility, understanding that he is a guardian of sacred medicine and a guide for souls in transformation.

I want to share my experience with Jay and his healing work. After struggling with addiction and mental health issues for years, I decided to reach out to Jay for help. From the very first conversation, I felt a sense of hope and understanding that I hadn't experienced in years. Jay's approach to healing is unlike anything I've encountered before. He combines ancient wisdom with modern understanding in a way that speaks directly to your soul. The retreat experience was transformative - not just the ceremonies themselves, but the entire journey of preparation, integration, and ongoing support. What impressed me most was Jay's genuine care for each person's individual journey. He doesn't use a one-size-fits-all approach, but instead tailors his guidance to what each person needs. The healing I experienced went far beyond what I thought was possible. I'm now living a life I never thought I could have - free from addiction, with clarity about my purpose, and genuine peace in my heart.

The Bwiti Tradition

Ancient wisdom, sacred rituals, and the path to spiritual enlightenment

The Bwiti Tradition is an ancient spiritual path originating from the forests of Gabon, Central Africa, carried for generations by the Fang, Mitsogo, and Apinji peoples. It is not a religion in the Western sense, but a way of life — a lived wisdom rooted in truth, self-knowledge, and direct experience.

At the heart of Bwiti is the understanding that everything we need is already within us. The tradition guides people to remember who they truly are beneath fear, trauma, addiction, and the stories that life places on them. Rather than giving beliefs to follow, Bwiti opens the door for people to see for themselves.

Iboga: The Teacher Plant

The sacred plant medicine Iboga is central within the Bwiti path. It is known as the "Tree of Knowledge," a master teacher that helps individuals reconnect with their soul, confront their truth, and release the burdens they've been carrying — sometimes for decades or even generations.

Within the Bwiti, Iboga is not used casually or recreationally. It is taken with deep reverence, ceremony, and preparation. Traditionally trained providers support guests spiritually, emotionally, and physically through the process, ensuring safety, clarity, and guidance.

A Tradition Built on Truth

Bwiti doesn't preach dogma. Instead, it teaches truth through direct experience:

🔍
Knowing Yourself

Discovering your authentic self beneath all conditioning

👁️
Seeing Your Life Clearly

Understanding the patterns and stories that shape your reality

🎯
Understanding Your Purpose

Connecting with your soul's mission and life direction

🕊️
Letting Go

Releasing what no longer serves your highest good

🔗
Reconnecting

Restoring connection with your soul and ancestors

💎
Living with Integrity

Embodying honesty, truth, and personal responsibility

Music, dance, fire, storytelling, and community all play important roles. These elements help open the senses, anchor the mind, and connect participants with the spiritual world.

A Path of Healing and Awakening

Many people come to Bwiti seeking healing from:

Addiction
Trauma
Depression
Disconnection
Patterns that keep repeating
A loss of direction

Through Iboga and the teachings, they often gain clarity, peace, and a renewed sense of who they are.

Preserving the Lineage

Traditionally trained Bwiti providers carry this knowledge with the highest respect. They serve as bridges between the ancient Gabonese wisdom and those searching for healing in the modern world. Their role is not to "fix" anyone, but to guide them back to themselves.

The preservation of this sacred tradition ensures that future generations can access these powerful teachings and continue the unbroken chain of wisdom that has been passed down for centuries through initiation, ceremony, and lived experience.

What is Iboga?

Discover the ancient wisdom of West African plant medicine

The Sacred Plant Medicine

Iboga, the root bark of the Iboga tree, is a West African plant medicine used for thousands of years by locals as a sacrament for deep healing and spiritual discovery. It is now renowned as the most effective plant medicine in promoting and sustaining positive long-term change in people's lives.

This powerful medicine works on multiple levels - physical, mental, and spiritual - offering profound insights and healing that can transform your relationship with yourself and the world around you.

Tabernanthe Iboga
The Grandfather Medicine

Recognized as one of humanity's most ancient visionary plant medicines, the Iboga plant flourishes in the dense rainforests of West Africa. For millennia, this sacred medicine has served as a cornerstone for healing and spiritual initiation, now emerging to share its profound wisdom with our modern world.

In an era where depression, anxiety, addiction, and illness have become widespread challenges, this powerful medicine offers essential keys to restoring and maintaining wellness within ourselves and our communities.

Physical Healing

The Iboga root contains potent bitter compounds that rapidly cleanse the body and address numerous physical conditions including heavy metal toxicity, viral infections, skin disorders, Lyme disease, chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, and digestive issues.

Spiritual & Mental Transformation

The visionary nature of this plant medicine often guides participants through profound inner journeys, enabling the release of past traumas and revealing the root causes of what prevents living with joy and purpose. Iboga effectively supports recovery from depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, attention disorders, addiction, and obsessive behaviors.

Addiction Recovery

Renowned for its remarkable anti-addictive properties, Iboga serves as a crucial ally in overcoming dependencies on stimulants, opiates, alcohol, nicotine, and various pharmaceuticals. Beyond physical detoxification and withdrawal relief, it invites deep introspection into the underlying reasons for substance use.

The Sacred Ceremony

During the Iboga ceremony, the inner root bark of the Tabernanthe Iboga plant is carefully prepared into a fine powder and consumed. While each person's experience is unique, the common journey leads inward—a profound exploration of self-discovery where participants reconnect with their soul and life purpose.

This sacred process grounds individuals in their authentic truth, awakening deep gratitude for life itself—the understanding that existence is the greatest gift of all. Iboga and the Bwiti tradition restore our reverence and connection to both Earth and ourselves, clearing away the accumulated burdens of life's challenges.
