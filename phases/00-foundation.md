## Brand Summary

### The Story

**Jason "Jay" Nzingo Gho Majanja** is a traditionally trained Iboga Bwiti provider who overcame 20+ years of addiction through the sacred medicine. Initiated in 2022 under 10th-generation Shaman Moughenda Mikala in Gabon, Africa, he now serves seekers in Canada through authentic Bwiti ceremonies.

### Core Message

> "We don't have to stay stuck in our suffering. There is light on the other side — and Iboga helps us find it."

### Brand Essence

- **Warrior-Healer** — Fierce protection, tender compassion
- **Truth-Teller** — Direct, honest, no sugarcoating
- **Bridge-Builder** — Ancient wisdom for modern healing
- **Guardian** — Sacred responsibility to the medicine and tradition
