## What Is Iboga Life Change?

Iboga Life Change is **Jay Nzingo's sacred healing practice**, offering authentic Bwiti-tradition Iboga ceremonies for transformation, addiction recovery, trauma healing, and spiritual awakening. Founded by Jason "Nzingo Gho Majanja" after his own profound transformation through Iboga, this practice bridges ancient Gabonese wisdom with modern healing needs.

This is not about escaping life. It's about helping people **return to life whole, present, sovereign, and awake.**

## The Founder's Story

**Jason "Jay" Nzingo Gho Majanja** walked through 20+ years of addiction and darkness before finding his path to freedom through Iboga. In 2022, his first ceremony in Cancun, Mexico ignited an unbreakable calling. Within two months, he traveled to Gabon, Africa to train under 10th-generation Shaman Moughenda Mikala in the Missoko Bwiti tradition.

> *"I was done with the struggling. I was done with the suffering. I was done with the pain."*

Jay's transformation through Iboga didn't just heal his wounds—it revealed his purpose as a **guardian of ancient wisdom**. Now based in Canada, he serves those seeking freedom from addiction, trauma, anxiety, depression, and emotional stagnation.

## Brand Philosophy

```
We don't have to stay stuck in our suffering.
There is light on the other side—
and Iboga helps us find it.

Everything we need is already within us.
The tradition guides people to remember
who they truly are beneath fear, trauma,
addiction, and the stories that life places on them.
```
