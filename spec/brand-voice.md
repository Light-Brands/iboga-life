## Writing Principles

### Do's

✓ **Lead with understanding** — Acknowledge where people are before offering solutions

✓ **Use "I" and "you"** — Personal, direct connection

✓ **Speak from experience** — "I've been there" carries more weight than "research shows"

✓ **Honor the journey** — Both the struggle and the courage to seek help

✓ **Be specific** — "20 years of addiction" is more powerful than "many years"

✓ **Use active voice** — "Iboga shows you" not "You are shown by Iboga"

✓ **Leave space** — Let words breathe. Short paragraphs. Room to think.

✓ **End with openness** — Questions, invitations, never pressure

### Don'ts

✗ **Don't use clinical language** — "Treatment protocol" vs "the journey"

✗ **Don't promise outcomes** — "Can help" not "will cure"

✗ **Don't use fear tactics** — No urgency pressure, no "act now" manipulation

✗ **Don't minimize** — Never "just" or "only" about someone's suffering

✗ **Don't be preachy** — Share, don't lecture. Offer, don't push.

✗ **Don't use excessive spiritual jargon** — Keep it accessible

✗ **Don't over-explain** — Trust the reader's intelligence

✗ **Don't be salesy** — This work sells itself to those who are ready

## Key Messages

### Core Narrative

> We don't have to stay stuck in our suffering. There is light on the other side — and Iboga helps us find it.

### Positioning Statements

**For addiction:**
> Iboga addresses addiction differently. It doesn't just ease withdrawal — it helps you see why you've been reaching for substances in the first place. The root cause, not just the symptom.

**For trauma:**
> The medicine creates space to face what you've been carrying — sometimes for decades — and finally let it go. Not by forcing, but by showing you the truth and giving you permission to release.

**For seekers:**
> Everything you need is already within you. The Bwiti tradition doesn't give you new beliefs to follow — it opens the door for you to see for yourself.

**For safety concerns:**
> This is sacred work, treated with the utmost seriousness. Proper screening, preparation, guidance, and integration aren't optional — they're essential to the journey.

Thanks for reaching out — that first step takes real courage.

I hear you. What you're going through is real, and it's valid.

Welcome. Take a breath. You're in the right place.
```

### Acknowledging Pain

```
I know what that exhaustion feels like. That moment where you realize 
something has to change.

Twenty years of my own struggle taught me that the pain is real —

What you're carrying is heavy. You don't have to carry it alone.
```

### Explaining the Work

```
Iboga works on multiple levels — physical, mental, spiritual. It's not 
about escaping reality; it's about seeing it clearly, maybe for the 
first time.

The ceremony is sacred. I hold the space while the medicine does its 
work, guiding you through whatever needs to surface.

This isn't a quick fix. It's deep work. But for those who are ready, 
it can be the most transformative experience of their lives.
```

### Call to Action

```
If this resonates with you, I'd love to have a conversation. No pressure, 
just honest talk about where you are and what might help.

Ready to take the first step? Reach out, and let's see if this path 
is right for you.

The door is open. When you're ready, I'll be here.
```

### Closing

```
Take care of yourself. This journey starts with you.

I'm here when you're ready.

Walk in truth.

## Message Examples by Audience

### Someone in Active Addiction

```
I hear you. That place you're in — feeling trapped, wondering if 
anything will ever work — I've been there.

For twenty years, I was caught in cycles I couldn't break. Until 
Iboga showed me something different. Not an escape, but a doorway.

If you're curious about what that might look like for you, I'm here 
to talk. No judgment, no pressure. Just honest conversation about 
where you are and what might help.
```

### Spiritual Seeker

```
That feeling of disconnection — like you're going through life but 
not really living it — that's its own kind of suffering.

The Bwiti tradition teaches that we already have everything we need 
inside us. We just forget. Iboga helps us remember.

If you're feeling called to explore this path, reach out. Let's talk 
about what you're seeking.
```

### Family Member Inquiring

```
Thank you for reaching out on behalf of someone you love. That takes 
courage and care.

I want to be honest with you: this work requires the person themselves 
to be ready. Ready to face themselves, ready to do the work, ready to 
change. It can't be forced.

What I can offer is information about what this journey involves, so 
you can share it with your loved one when the time feels right. And 
if they do reach a point of readiness, the door will be open.
```

### Healthcare Professional

```
I appreciate you reaching out. I understand you may have questions 
about how this work complements conventional approaches.

Iboga has been used for thousands of years in the Bwiti tradition for 
healing and spiritual initiation. My training comes directly from this 
lineage — initiated under a 10th-generation shaman in Gabon.

I take safety seriously. Proper screening, preparation, and integration 
are essential parts of this work. I'm happy to discuss more about the 
process and what it involves.
```

## Emergency Response Protocol

### If someone expresses immediate danger:

```
If you're in immediate danger or having a medical emergency, please 
contact emergency services (911) right now.

This is serious, and getting immediate help is the most important thing.

Once you're safe, reach back out if you'd like to talk. But right now, 
focus on getting the support you need in this moment.
```

### If someone expresses suicidal thoughts:

```
I hear that you're in a really dark place right now. That pain is real.

Please reach out to a crisis line — they're trained to help in moments 
like this:
- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741

You reaching out means something. There is still fight in you. 
But right now, please get immediate support from people trained for this.

When you're through this moment, I'll be here.
